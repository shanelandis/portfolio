## Why Your Brand Needs a Unique Voice
When it comes to the connections between businesses and consumers, they start tenuously. Brands convey trust to gain the ticket to consumer loyalty, and one of the best ways to do so is through developing a brand voice. A dash of clarity, conciseness, and consistency are the required ingredients that make up this skill enforced by the world’s biggest businesses. In this article, we detail a few ways to grow this ability.

# 3 Ways to Develop a Voice for Your Brand
From Airbnb’s personal and approachable tone to LEGO’s imagination-focused advertisements, many brands focus on creating a distinctive voice. Here are a few ways to develop your own:

1.	Crafting Brand Vocabulary
Having your own lexicon gives your consumers words to remember your brand by. If you think of iPhone and iPad or “just do it,” most people know which brands these phrases originate from. Similarly, you can create your own phrases or words for people to associate your brand with. There’s multiple ways to brainstorm a new brand lexicon:

1.	Analyze your audience
2.	Experiment with wordplay
3.	Create a board with new ideas
4.	Review how your brand changed since its inception

2.	Personifying Your Brand
Identifying an audience is the easy part of figuring out your brand voice, but knowing how to speak to this audience is what’s difficult. The most important thing in figuring out your voice is giving your voice relatable and memorable traits, such as a witty, serious, or friendly persona.  Eliciting emotions that align with your brand’s values gives the consumer one extra reason to pick you over competitors.

3.	Actively Adjusting for Separate Audiences
Shifting voices between audiences is your greatest asset. People want to feel a connection with your brand, and the best way to accomplish that is through appealing to the way they speak.

An example is Duolingo, who changes their voice between their media platforms. Their TikTok page, which appeals to Gen Z, is socially conscious, energetic, and witty so they garner downloads for their platform. On the other hand, their Facebook page, which appeals to the older generations, is personal, clear, and community-oriented. Figuring out these audiences and attracting them through your tone is a great way to build brand recognition.
