# ðŸ“„ Overview

Hello!

Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review <code>[my technical writing portfolio](https://marytanaelportfolio.com/)</code>.

Here's some quick info about me: I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Creative Writing. I have over four years of experience in content writing, copywriting, technical writing, and editing. (You can learn more about me <code>[here](https://github.com/marytanaelwriter)</code>.)

Since I recently transitioned to the IT industry, my tech writing experience is limited. I also signed a nondisclosure agreement in my previous job, so I can't share my tech writing outputs anywhere. I created this portfolio to address these gaps.

My writing samples include a process document, a quickstart guide, and a how-to guide. I'm also currently working on a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page and a video script, and I plan to add them here once I finish. Moreover, I believe in continuous improvement, so Iâ€™ll constantly update my samples as I see fit.

It's still a work in progress, but I hope my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills. Please check my <code>[online CV](https://marytanaelwriter.com)</code> or <code>[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marytanaelwriter)</code> to learn more about my qualifications.

Thank you!

Mary
